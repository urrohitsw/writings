A lot of things happened this year.

After 3 dismal years in Bangalore doing absolutely nothing (apart from office work of course), I finally felt like I have been able to get my hands on a couple of things this year.
The biggest highlight of the year was getting back to books. I had resoluted to read 20 books in 2016. This resolution was taken up out of sheer frustration that the only source of entertainment for me had been
watching the same old TV serials again and again, as I apprehended getting addicted to new serials if I started watching one. This paid of really
well. I am currently reading 16th book. Although, I will not be able to complete the challenge, I am happy with the progress I have
made. 

I also started to take interest in the physical activities. I used to jog 3kms everyday for about a month and half. Although I have
stopped now, I am satisfied that, I was able to follow this routine for so long. I have also taken up playing badminton almost every week
thanks to some friends and colleaugues. I would like to believe that, I have some very good progress in that respect. Though I
continue to suffer from health upsets, I have come to accept them as part and parcel of Bangalore life.

I also spent a considerable amount of time vacationing this year. Most memorable time would be the trek to Hemkund Sahib and Valley of
Flowers. Although I had planned to do solo bike trips to the nearby places, I couldn't materilize it this year.

The last but not the least high point of this year is some of the non-official technical work that I did. I got some good stuff done
on my Raspberry Pi. This also got me thinking on what my future career options are. 

Life's not a fairy tale and there are couple of things which left me unhappy. Top on this list would be not going on solo trips. I
would also like to work on building up an independent profile for myself. I should start working on this more seriously.

All in all, I feel this was a year well spent !!
